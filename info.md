I would say that my Computer Science experience is very limited. Since I changed my major late, I haven’t been able to take the biggest variety of classes up to this point, and was asked to be put in this class to graduate on time.  I was I am most proficient in Java, although I have been taking time to experience other languages. I am currently experimenting with Python, C++, and HTML. My biggest project was a text based adventure game that I created in java on BlueJ, though that file has been lost. I am currently working on a Java Window Application Project on Eclipse, focused on event management for a student advisory program. 
I’ve been very interested in web based development and application creation. I really hope the experience I obtain in this class will enable me to start up some personal projects, as well as hopefully help expand my resume for the future.
